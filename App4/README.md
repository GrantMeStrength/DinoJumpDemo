# DinoJump Demo app

## A UWP app written in JavaScript, with EaselJS

The Windows Store is a straightforward way to distributed or sell your apps, and it supports any app written for the UWP (Universal Windows Platform). 
Often UWP apps are written in C# and XAML, but that is certainly not the only way. This app is a very simple game written in JavaScript, making use of the EaselJS library, and demonstrates drawing sprites, creating a game loop, working with the keyboard and adapting to different screen sizes.

This project is created with Visual Studio, giving us all the benefits of the IDE and debugging tools. Once the app is working, it can be published to the Windows Store, or with minor changes, hosted on a website or adapted to other platforms.
## Getting stared

This project is built using Visual Studio. Visual Studio Community Edition is free, and can be downloaded from http://visualstudio.com.

EaselJS is a JavaScript framework designed to make it easy to create sprite-based games. It is already present in the project (look for js/easeljs-0.8.2.min.js in the Solution Explorer). Full details (and other related downloads) can be obtained from http://www.createjs.com/easeljs).

Download this project directly from GitHub to your computer, and load the solution into Visual Studio. Press F5 to run the game: although you will need to make some changes before you can play it fully.
